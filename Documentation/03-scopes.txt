Scopes are just like in C:

{ SCOPE } NOT IN SCOPE

in scopes you can write code just as jou can write code out of them.

They are used for statements, function definitions...
Scopes have their own variables:

int a = 0

{
  a /// 0
  int a = 10
  int i = 3
  a /// 10
  i /// 3
  int a = 13 /// error redeclaration of a
}

a /// 10
i /// error i does not exist


The reason, second delaration wasn't error, because a was created in scope and it will be deleted afterwards, the thirs declaration is error, because a is already delared in scope. The a before it was declared was valid, because for variables it can look for parent scopes, if in variale doesnt exist in current scope. Global variables are look at last.
