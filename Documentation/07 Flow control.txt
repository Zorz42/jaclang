Flow control lets you choose what code will get executed

if expression {
	code
}

"if statement" evaluates expression and if its 0 the it does not execute that code, otherwise it does.

while expression {
	code
}

"while statement" repeats executing that code until expression is false

example:

int a = 0

while a < 10 {
	a = a + 1
}
