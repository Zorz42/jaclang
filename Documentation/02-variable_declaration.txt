- You can declare variable, like:
	int a = 0;
(semicolon is optional)
    
For now you can not declare more variables in a sigle expression, or leave them undefined.
- You do not necesserily need ; for terminating expression. If compiler sees that the expression could end and if there is newline, it terminates it. eg.
int a = 1 +
1 + 2 +
1

This will count as one expression, because equation cannot end with operator.
int a = 1 + 1
+ 1 + 2

Only first line will count as expression.
int a = (1 + 1
+ 1 + 2)

You can fix that, because the expression will not be valid with open brace, therefore it cannot end.
This will not take performance, because if compiler seen plain braces in equation, that do't have an advantage over anything, then it will remove those, but expression will stay.

Equations will have +, -, *, /  and braces.
Single-line comments will be with triple-slash (///), because double-slash (//) is reserved for floor dividing
