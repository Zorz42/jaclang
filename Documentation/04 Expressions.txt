Expressions are used everywhere and they have some rules:

Expressions can have +, -, *, /, <, >, == and braces,

They can be in multiple lines without any backslashes.


This can bring some ambiguity:


10

-10 + 5


Here you clearly meant two expressions (10 and -10 + 5) but compiler recognized it as one ( 10 - 10 + 5 ).

You can fix this by putting braces around first part:


10

(-10) + 5


Comparisons will result in 1 if true and 0 if false.
