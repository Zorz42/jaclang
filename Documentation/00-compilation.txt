Compilation from jl code to assembly:

input.jl -> tokens -> ast -> out.s

This whole process is done in main function in main.cpp.

The first part is done by lexer (lexer/core.cpp), the second part is done by parser (parser/core.cpp), the third part is made by generator (generator/core.cpp).

All those files are in src (source files).
