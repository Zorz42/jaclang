I really care about the binary code of being small and fast, suitable for slower computers. I want compilation times to be as slow as needed, to make the maximum efficiency. I am thinking about a minute, compared to ten seconds. You could also do option to fast compile, for testing. If anyone thinks, this is a bad idea, he should comment and tell why he thinks so.
