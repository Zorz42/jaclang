 * Jaclang is trying to achieve as small compiled binaries as possible.
 * 
 * I really care about the binary code of being small and fast, suitable for slower computers. I want compilation times 
 * to be as slow as needed, to make the maximum efficiency. You could also do option to fast compile, for testing.
 * 
 * Support:
 * 
 * - 64 bit computers,
 * - linux and macos (most linux distros, tested on Ubuntu)
 * 
 * Syntax will be almost the same as C++.
 * 
 *  THE ZEN OF JACLANG:
 * 
 * - execution time of compiled code is more important than compilation time,
 * - syntax should be pure
 * - practicality beats purity
 * - size of compiled binaries should be as small as possible
 *
 * Version tags are stable versions. 
 * Master branch is the latest version in development. Might be unstable and full of bugs.
