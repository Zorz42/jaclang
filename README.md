Jaclang is trying to achieve as small compiled binaries as possible.

Support:

* 64 bit computers,
* linux and macos (most linux distros, tested on Ubuntu and other distros) 

THE ZEN OF JACLANG:

* execution time of compiled code is more important than compilation time,
* compiled binaries as small as possible
* syntax should be pure
* practicality beats purity

Version tags are stable versions. 
Master branch is the latest version in development. Might be unstable and full of bugs.
