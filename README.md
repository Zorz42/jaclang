# jaclang beta
jaclang is like C programming language very fast and light

// PROJECT MADE BY JAKOB

INSTALLATION PROCESS:
1. Download zip and unzip it.
2. Open terminal and go to unzipped folder.
3. Type make (you will need sudo).
4. Jaclang is installed at /usr/local/bin



 * Jaclang is trying to achieve as small compiled binaries as possible. Predefined variables, are not defined by default, 
 * you have to enable them, because you might not use them. Defined will be 
 * the core data. You can enable to track execution time, because if you do 
 * not need it, it will only take performance.  
 * 
 * I really care about the binary code of being small and fast, suitable for slower computers. I want compilation times 
 * to be as slow as needed, to make the maximum efficiency. I am thinking about a minute, compared to ten seconds. 
 * You could also do option to fast compile, for testing.
 * Support:
 * 
 * - 64 bit computers,
 * - linux and macos (linux distros with apt)
 * 
 * This language is not begginer friendly.
 * Syntax will be almost the same as C++. Some 
 * unnecessary tokens will be removed.
 * 
 *  THE ZEN OF JACLANG:
 * 
 * - execution time of compiled code is more important than compilation time,
 * - hirearhical is better than flat,
 * - purity is imortant
 * - practicality beats purity
 * - size of compiled binaries should be as small as possible
 *
 * Version tags are stable versions. 
 * Master branch is the latest version in development. Might be unstable and full of bugs.
