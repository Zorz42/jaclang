# jaclang
jaclang is like C programming language very fast and light

// --------------------------
// PROJECT MADE BY JAKOB
// --------------------------

 *
 * It is trying to achieve as small compiled binaries as possible. Predefined variables, are not defined by default, 
 * you have to enable them, because you might not use them. Defined will be 
 * the core data. You can enable to track execution time, because if you do 
 * not need it, it will only take performance.  
 * 
 * Support:
 * 
 * - ONLY 64 bit computers,
 * - ONLY linux, for now - compiled binary, (for sources maybe you can compile for mac too)
 * - NASM compiler,
 * - Intel architecture CPU.
 * 
 * This language is not begginer friendly.
 * Syntax will be almost the same as C++. Some 
 * unnecessary tokens will be removed.
 * 
 *  THE ZEN OF JACLANG: (like python)
 * 
 * - execution time of compiled code is more important than compilation time,
 * - hirearhical is better than flat,
 * - purity is imortant
 * - practicality beats purity (from python, I agree)
 * - size of compiled binaries should be as small as possible
 *
